        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>How HTML works</h3>
        <p>HTML is the main part of the site. The tags that display the site normally are used here. These can be arranged into either paragraphs, or lists.</p>
        <h3>How CSS works</h3>
        <p>CSS determines how the site appears. Using CSS is very useful, but remember that using CSS is slightly more complex than usual. you need selectors, classes, and IDs.</p>

        <h2>HTML fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>Tags are the main thing that are used in HTML. These are used to write text, make lists, add images and videos, and make links that go to 
            other pages.
        </p>
        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>Each tag is used to make various elements, and are important when making a website!</p>
        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        <ul>Attributes are used in elements and tags, allowing you to adjust those, and examples include things like:</ul>
            <li>Headers, because you can use them for titles of pages, or paragraphs.</li>
            <li>Lists, so you can order them, when adding text or links</li>
            <li>Images and Videos, because you can adjust the size of them.</li>
        <p>still not putting them within distance of other tags, but that's what CSS is for!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decoration">
        <h2>CSS fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Selectors</h3>
        <p>Selectors are used for ways to add in adjustments on text. they can be used on tags, classes, and IDs (more on the other 2 below)</p>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>Classes can be used the same way, but the main difference is that using a class ends up affecting EVERYTHING in the class, via a period and the tag after
            unless you put a CSS to something directly in the site.
        </p>
        <h3>IDs</h3>
        <p>No, IDs are not your personal information! Instead, IDs can affect a certain thing in the code, and is usually used with a #.</p>
